Es conocido que la tecnología blockchain utiliza criptografía y tecnología de timestamp en la capa de datos (Data), que emplea conexiones peer-to-peer para el intercambio de información en la capa de red, que implementa algoritmos de consenso para validar la información y que usa scripts y algoritmos para implementar smart contracts en diversos lenguajes de base. Este entorno de trabajo asegura varias cuestiones relacionadas con la consistencia, la trazabilidad y la inmutabilidad de la información, pero no por ello queda exento a posibles ataques de seguridad que lo comprometan.

Cybersecurity risk. For a variety of reasons, blockchain networks have proven to be favorite targets for hackers. While no blockchain has been successfully hacked or manipulated, the companies and technology surrounding it have been. Security incidents have ranged from mundane service disruptions to more serious thefts of sensitive data and valuable cryptocurrencies, although the decentralized structure of blockchain networks makes them more resilient against network-wide attacks or tampering.

Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is the foundation of blockchain (see Box, Blockchain Glossary). DLT offers a consensus validation mechanism through a network of computers that facilitates peer-to-peer transactions without the need for an intermediary or a centralized authority to update and maintain the information generated by the transactions. Each transaction is validated and, along with a group of validated transactions, is added as a new “block” to an already existing chain of transactions, giving rise to the name “blockchain.” Once a transaction has been added to the chain, it generally cannot be altered or removed. (See Box, A Visual Representation of Blockchain.)

There are two types of blockchain networks: Permissioned blockchains. These networks are proprietary networks that specific individuals or entities use to conduct transactions (such as a group of banks processing financial transactions).

Permissionless or public blockchains. These are opensource networks that anyone can access and use (such as bitcoin users who transact with each other using bitcoin for payment).

Unlike the bitcoin blockchain and other public networks, permissioned blockchain networks are typically developed by companies for their own private commercial use. Organizations may develop their own network or customize a basic network previously developed by a vendor. In some cases, a group of companies in an industry may collaborate to develop and share a proprietary network to facilitate transactions among them, such as the R3 blockchain consortium, which offers a blockchain system for financial institutions.
