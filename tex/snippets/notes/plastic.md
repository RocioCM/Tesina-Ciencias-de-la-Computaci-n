FUENTE: alnuaimi2023blockchain Blockchain‑based system for tracking and rewarding recyclable plastic waste

Abstract: Industrialization and the rapid increase in the world population have led to the generation of a large amount of plastic waste. Efficient recycling of such waste and fairly rewarding the general public for their services and efforts are two challenging problems. A large portion of today’s systems and technologies that are leveraged for managing plastic waste disposal pro- cesses and rewarding people for their services fall short of providing transparency, traceability, reliability, security, and trust features. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution for managing and tracking recyclable plastic waste using the Ethereum blockchain, along with decentralized storage technology to handle massive volumes of data. Our proposed solution also introduces a reward scheme for people to honor their efforts. Also, our proposed solution establishes trust and accountability among stakeholders who typically participate in the waste management system and also ensures fair reward practices. We present the system architecture along with full implementation and testing details. For better usability, we deploy a decentralized application (DApp) on top of the smart contracts. We evaluate the proposed solution’s functionality and performance using security and cost analyses and compare it with the existing solutions. Our results demonstrate that adopting a blockchain-based approach reduces inefficiencies and is an economical and commercially viable solution. We also make the smart contracts’ code publicly available on GitHub.

Hence, encouraging recycling with the aim of diverting plastic bottles from landfills is of great importance. Both people who make an effort to recycle and those who do not express that they are unaware of who is handling recyclable waste, how it is handled, and whether it is actually being recycled. The ambiguity of the waste man- agement process has led to a lack of motivation to recycle as the results of the process are not observable. According to [4], American recyclable plastic waste is exported to devel- oping countries in exchange for monetary sums. The expor- tation of plastic waste presents serious ethical concerns as the plastic is mismanaged, thus posing a significant threat to local residents. Providing total transparency of the recycling process will not only encourage the public to recycle, but will also help authoritative entities regulate waste manage- ment companies and how they deal with plastic waste.

The forward supply chain of plastic bottled water involves delivering bottles from manufacturing plants to consumers. This half of the supply chain is transparent in comparison to the reverse chain. The reverse supply chain involves the col- lection of used water bottles, sorting, and preparing them for re-manufacturing. In addition, the traditional linear economy approach used for plastic handling depletes resources used in plastic manufacturing [5]. The study conducted in [6] presents the potential harm that linear economy approaches of solid municipal waste pose on the environment. This is why plastic production, alongside numerous other industries, is attempting to move from the traditional linear economic approach to a circular economy where resources can re-enter the supply chain, instead of being wasted. All these difficul- ties in handling recyclable plastic waste prove the need for a system that provides traceability of recyclable plastic waste while encouraging the general public to recycle more often.

A number of technology-based and non-technology- based waste management solutions have been operational in the UAE. Non-technology-based solutions mostly consist of municipality-retailer collaborations for the collection of post-consumer recyclable plastic bottles [7]. The collected plastic is either dumped into landfills, allocated to recycling facilities, or entered into waste-to-energy programs. As for technology-based solutions, the Bee’ah Reverse Vending Machine (RVM) is a prominent example. The RVM is a col- lection machine utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) technology to reward the participant with a receipt to enter a monthly draw for depositing plastic bottles and aluminum cans [8]. Another example of a technology-based solution is ZeLoop, a blockchain-based mobile application that offers monetary rewards for depositing plastic waste in verified recycling locations [9]. At a verified disposing location, the user uploads a picture of their disposed plastic bottles. An algo- rithm is run to estimate the number of bottles and rewards the participant with an Ethereum-based token accordingly. While these solutions do a decent job of incentivizing recy- cling, they do not solve the issues of ambiguity and lack of transparency.

In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based system to provide an end-to-end traceability solution for tracking recyclable plastic waste and a secure approach to reward- ing recyclers for their participation in green habits. The proposed solution is feasible through the use of blockchain technology because of its inherent characteristics such as decentralization, immutability, and security. By utiliz- ing blockchain capabilities, we demonstrate an automated method to allocate recyclable waste to vetted manufacturers to be reused through an auctioning mechanism. By taking this approach, we achieve our ultimate goal since full trans- parency is essential to building trust, motivating sustain- able practices, and creating an optimised supply chain for stakeholders to increase recycling. Moreover, we designed our solution using the Ethereum platform because Ethereum is popular with both public and private networks.

• We propose a blockchain-based approach for transpar- ent tracing of recyclable plastic waste. The proposed approach dynamically maps a unique hash to plastic bales. Hence, plastic waste can be tracked in a manner that is decentralized, transparent, reliable, secure, and trustworthy.

• We implement an auctioning technique to ensure a fair allocation of recyclable waste to manufacturers. In addi- tion, a rewarding mechanism for recyclers is introduced as an incentive in exchange for their plastic waste.

• We develop four Ethereum blockchain-based smart con- tracts. We discuss the sequence of interactions showing the function calls and events. We explain the different functionalities of the smart contract. We present impor- tant features of the deployed decentralized application (DApp). We make our smart contracts code publicly available on Github 1 .

• We present implementation and testing details of the developed smart contracts and the DApp. We conduct cost and security analyses to evaluate the performance of the proposed blockchain-based tracing and rewarding recyclable plastic waste management system. Addition- ally, we compare our proposed approach with the existing solutions

Estado del arte: Destaca soluciones previas utilizando únicamente IoT. A diferencia de otros trabajos (SmartCitizen App), el trabajo 23 elimina la necesidad de bolsas inteligentes al rastrear individualmente los desechos, específicamente los plásticos. El modelo propuesto utiliza códigos de respuesta rápida (QR) impresos en plásticos en el momento de la fabricación. El código QR contiene la dirección criptográfica y detalles plásticos. Las partes interesadas de este sistema incluyen el público en general, los usuarios finales, los recolectores de basura, los fabricantes, los minoristas, el gobierno, los gobiernos locales y las unidades de reciclaje. Esta solución integra IoT a través de contenedores que leen los códigos QR de los productos. Posteriormente, se otorgan recompensas a participantes individuales, fabricantes y unidades de reciclaje a través de ZEROApp. La tecnología Blockchain se utiliza para gestionar tokens y rastrear plásticos. Las recompensas se utilizan para el pago de bienes y servicios. El modelo puede hacerse conveniente y rentable reemplazando varios contenedores inteligentes con una máquina clasificadora inteligente en las instalaciones. El trabajo presentado en este artículo proporciona una solución mejorada a los artículos revisados. Este sistema proporciona una solución rentable al implementar dispositivos inteligentes únicamente en las instalaciones de clasificación. Por el contrario, los estudios mencionados propusieron dispositivos IoT en barrios y camiones de recogida. Además, el sistema añade comodidad al eliminar las bolsas inteligentes y la interacción del usuario final con los dispositivos IoT.

Plastic waste has become one of the most formidable environmental problems of our age, and solving it without increasing other environmental burdens will require approaches that tackle wider concerns around the unsustainable use of resources. However, at present, recy- cling technologies and waste management systems do not yet record the impacts due to the amounts of plastic waste being gen- erated.Encouraging customers to reduce single use plastic consump- tion and motivating plastic producers to produce more recy- clable plastics are essential to the health of the global environment.

Important to our study is the fact that more than 20 dif- ferent recycling labels for plastic alone exist in the market, and customers are confused about which plastic products are recy- clable and which products are actually recycled. clear plastics labelling is a powerful way to help consumers buy more recyclable and recycled products and to dispose of them correctly.

To address the problem of ambigu- ous plastic labeling, this paper proposes a credit system based on the quality of the plastic. From the outset, however, this study finds that the main challenge behind the credit system is the engendering of trust between customers and plastic pro- duct manufacturers, and among plastic producers and manufac- turers of goods which use plastic, where neither verification of actual plastic usage nor credit authenticity in this process can yet take place. A transparent and secure platform for generating and checking credit information is therefore essential in the plastic management system.

Large companies or organizations need to be responsible for the plastics they make, use, or sell, and the note is issued by a third accredited party, a reprocessor, as evidence of the receipt of a certain tonnage of packaging waste. However, such a centralized system generally has significant drawbacks, such as a crisis of trust caused by recycling information asym- metry and information that can be tampered with easily. Decen- tralization can solve this problem by providing an immutable record within a trusted environment. Blockchain provides the equitable management of credit information and interface for the public to check on a secure distributed ledger book

In this context, we propose a blockchain-based PlasticChain for managing the plastic credit for plastic products/companies. In a PlasticChain system customers are able to retrieve credit information as a reference before choosing a product. Plastic producers and product manufacturers can publish means of production contracts and plastic production information to form a self-regulated body that can check the information’s validity.

In order to promote waste prevention, government and local authorities have also proposed economic instruments, including taxes, fees and charges, Deposit-Refund Systems (DRS), subsidies, a tradable permit system, and so on. These instruments use different economic models to stimulate municipal waste prevention and improve resource efficiency.

In the public blockchain, participants are allowed to take part anonymously, and access the network and blockchain without permission. The transactions on the blockchain are available for checking, and all peers are allowed to make transactions (Jaag and Bach, 2017). In the consortium blockchain, access and update operations are only allowed for members of the consortium. Only the selected set of nodes are responsible for validating the blockchain in the network (Marc, 2016). The private blockchain is applied in private organizations for database management and auditing.

PlasticChain is a plastic product-based blockchain system in which products containing raw plastic are produced by private sector plastic manufacturers. The label on the plastic product gives the plastic credit information, and may also contain the plastic type and composition (given on a voluntary basis). Users are able to collect the plastic information from the label and verify its authenticity on PlasticChain. The plastic products are labelled by manufacturers where the corresponding factory or company is responsible for providing the correct information to customers. The information is distributed in an off-chain manner so that it is not directly involved in the blockchain. As illustrated in Fig. 1, PlasticChain can be divided into several different components described as follows:
