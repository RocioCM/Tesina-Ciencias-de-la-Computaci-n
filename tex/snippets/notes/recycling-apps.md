Circularise is the leading blockchain platform that provides digital product passports for end-to-end traceability and secure data exchange for industrial supply chains.

Unlock your supply chain data

￼

Traceability beyond tier 1

Today consumers and regulators want to know the sustainability impact of products and services. Use Circularise's digital product passports to have a detailed record of your product's origin, material composition, LCA and environmental data backed by blockchain-powered chain of custody.

￼

Primary data collection for LCA/PCF

Gather primary data across the supply chain to conduct comprehensive Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs), calculate Product Carbon Footprint (PCF), establish a trustworthy record of a product's environmental impact.

￼

Regulatory compliance

Report against key sustainability performance indicators and speed up the auditing process. Share data on the product’s sourcing, carbon footprint, child labour and human rights to comply with regulations and certifications such as the EU Battery Regulation.

A privacy-first approach to supply chain transparency

We bring together everything that's required to build transparent and sustainable supply chains. Circularise's products are designed with data privacy at the core for suppliers, manufacturers, OEMs, brands, recyclers and everyone in between. We help companies to gain visibility in their supply chains backed by trustworthy data.

Selective data sharing

Be in full control of which data you want to share to comply with customer and regulatory requirements while keeping sensitive information private. Leverage Circularise's proprietary technology to selectively share information while safeguarding confidential data.

Integration with your ERP

2

Use our API to integrate digital product passports and automate mass balance bookkeeping with your organisation’s ERP (e.g. SAP). Setup a scalable system from day one.

Open and interoperable

3

Embrace an open and interoperable approach to build scalable digital product passports from day one. Team up with Circularise to eliminate data silos, seamlessly linking data across complex supply chains.

Circularise and project partners used a public blockchain, making it virtually impossible for companies to appear more sustainable than they really are by reusing the proof of a sustainability claim across assets. This principle forms the foundation of trust in data integrity. 

“Blockchain technology is revolutionising how data is stored and shared. Now companies don’t need to individually keep a balance of goods and transactions in excel. Instead they can use blockchain and smart contracts to store balances, record transactions, and apply mass balance rules. Every transaction is fully traceable. Auditors can therefore rely on the blockchain for parts of the audit,” said Mesbah Sabur, Circularise’s Founder. “We are excited to bring our knowledge in supply chain traceability and data management to project partners to test a public decentralised blockchain with the ISCC Plus certification.”

Empowering Better Business

Amidst the many factors contributing to the climate crisis, the significant role of industrial supply chains can no longer be ignored.  

Circulor provides the most complete and mature solution to this pressing global problem by enabling companies to gain visibility into their supply chains to demonstrate responsible sourcing, improve their ESG performance, reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and manage the supply chain risks.

Since we started in 2018, we have collaborated with our partners and clients to understand how traceability and due diligence of raw materials and recycled content can achieve net-zero.

Recycling

Circulor’s solutions are already ensuring closed loop recycling of materials including electronics, plastics and EV batteries. Traceability data also prove that the recycling or disposal process is conducted responsibly.

Waste is a strategic resource. Lowering the amount of waste generated and improving end of life handling are essential for building a more circular economy, where waste is reduced, resources are conserved and are fed back into the supply chain for new products. 

Furthermore many of the issues found in extractive industries will be reduced if recycling rates increase as it reduces the reliance on newly mined material.

Blockchain Technology

All of Circulor’s solutions are developed on a private, permissioned-based enterprise SaaS platform that includes intuitive user interfaces, embedded business logic, clear dependencies, and integrated operations that are multilingual.

 

Our user-friendly desktop application can be used for fast manual upload, and our mobile application ensures an inclusive low barrier to entry for upstream participants.

 

Our technology has been designed for ease of integration with existing enterprise platforms; data can be fed seamlessly to the blockchain via system integration using RESTful Web Service APIs with security and authentication protocols. 

 

Circulor advocates interoperability; we supported the establishment of the RMI Blockchain guidelines and contribute to leading-edge research in this space

Without knowing the provenance of goods or materials, it is difficult to ensure social and environmental standards are effectively applied across complex and global supply chains. 

 

Our traceability products track the origin of raw materials and the actual flow of materials through the production processes and transformations they undergo within manufacturing and recycling supply chains. This granular, real-time data enables tracking of the scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and associated ESG data, in order to demonstrate responsible sourcing, sustainability, and circularity. 

 

We do this by creating a digital twin at source and tracking the digital identity of the materials journey as it changes state, to provide full visibility across traditionally opaque supply chains.

Transparency into emissions is critical to ensuring a comprehensive and holistic approach to supply chain sustainability. 

 

Circulor’s Sustainability products enable clients to dynamically measure their attributed and inherited emissions at each stage of the supply chain, enhancing current lifecycle assessment approaches. 

 

We work with our clients to define their ESG KPIs, underpinned by traceability data, to support them in measuring and comparing sustainability credentials of their suppliers and benchmarking against overall ESG targets. This enables them to drive improvements across the supply chain and where relevant, make visible to their customers.

Risk management is key to ensuring responsible sourcing, eliminating waste and stimulating best practices within the supply chain.

 

Circulor’s products augment traceability data with data from third party sources to investigate supply chain participants and identify any potential risks.

​

We do this by identifying anomalies and deviations across the supply chain, flagging to the responsible organisation and downstream participants. Corrective action can be taken with a full audit trail whilst retaining immutable record on the Blockchain

WHAT IT IS

 

Transparency and Traceability of Recycled Plastic

Certified Recycled Plastic® is the transcription system that guarantees the traceability of recycled plastic material. Thanks to Blockchain technology, Certified Recycled Plastic® creates an immutable record of material transactions to ensure accuracy and transparency along the entire recycling chain

Certified Recycled Plastic® is a European Union trademark.

 

THE CHALLENGE

By 2025, 25% of packaging will have to contain recycled plastic.

THE SOLUTION

Certified Recycled Plastic® ensures the traceability of plastic material and the verifiability of environmental claims

LEARN MORE

 

Certified Recycled Plastic® promotes the circular economy

According to the definition given by the European Parliament , the circular economy is "a model of production and consumption that involves sharing, lending, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products as long as possible".

The goal of the circular economy is to extend the lifecycle of products, thus contributing to waste reduction. To achieve this purpose, the model proposes to reintroduce into the economic cycle products already used, transforming waste into resources and creating further value.

Certified Recycled Plastic® supports the circular economy in two ways: on the one hand, it offers plastic industries the certainty of treating recycled materials that comply with regulations and, on the other, by recording the "history" of the material up to the finished product, it raises awareness among consumers and directs them towards more informed and sustainable choices.

WASTE MANAGEMENT CONTRACTOR / MUNICIPALITY

The second life of plastic packaging begins with citizens' commitment to proper waste sorting. For this reason, the recycling process first involves municipalities, that manage waste on territories following different methods and regulations.

￼

CONSORTIUM

Once at the Sorting Facility, plastic products are sorted by polymer and, in the case of PET, also by color, to obtain homogeneous materials. The packaging thus divided comes out of the facility in the form of bales of PET, HDPE, film and mixed-polyolefin, ready to be sold to Recycling Facilities.

￼

RECYCLER

At the Recycling Facility, polymers are subjected to various treatments and controls to obtain Secondary Raw Materials (SRMs). The last step of the recycling process is the so-called shredding or grinding, which allows reducing the material into smaller pieces.

￼

REPROCESSOR

The SRMs obtained in recycling facilities continue their path at Reprocessors, where they are transformed into semi-finished products, which are characterized by extreme versatility for the realization of articles of any shape and size.

￼

FINISHED PRODUCT MANUFACTURER

Here, plastic materials begin their second life taking the most diverse shapes and functions: among these, design objects such as lamps, chairs and armchairs, street and garden furniture, shopping carts, vases, but also glasses frames and pile clothing.
